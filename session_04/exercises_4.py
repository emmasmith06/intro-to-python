    print(year)
  
# 5. Create a list of ten random numbers. Loop through your list and count the number of even numbers and the number of odd numbers.
randomnums = randrange(10)
evencount = 0
offcount = 0
for num in randomnums:
  if num%2==0:
    evencount += num
  else:
    oddcount += num

# 6. Create a list of five names. Write a loop that will print "Hello" plus each name in the list.
